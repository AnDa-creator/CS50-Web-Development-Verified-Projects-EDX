# Project 2

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

HEllo , here I have implemented the project in two files mainly.
==================================================================
This is a single-paged app :)
==================================================================

1. Display Name: 
On initial page the user is asked for a name 
which gets stored in localstorage. So its 
indeed browser remembered except while used 
in incognito mode. 

===============================================

2.Channel Creation: 
Each user can create channel and simultaneously 
view it anytime during the whole chatting process.

================================================

3.Message view and sending messages: 
Once in a channel, the user can view the previous 
messages and send messages. The timestamp in local time 
and name is shown. For user send message, own messages 
are right aligned and that for others they are left aligned.

================================================

4.Remembering the channel:
The channel is remembered through the server. On reopening 
the browser, one is redirected to the last page.

================================================

5.Personal Touch:
I have added an option to delete own messages. However, 
the message doesn't get deleted from other user's page 
instantly. But on reload it disappears as it is removed 
from server.

=================================================
