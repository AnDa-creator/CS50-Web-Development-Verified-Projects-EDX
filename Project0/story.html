						<h2 class="text-success" id="section1"> What is the electric grid? </h2>
						<p class="text-info"> Most of us don't give a second thought to where our electricity comes from. The truth is that the power grid is the biggest engineering 
						achievement of the 20th century and one of the most indispensable machines on Earth.

							Every day, the grid powers our lives in amazing ways.</p>
						<h2 class="text-success" id="section2"> RELIABLE POWER PROVIDES THE FOUNDATION FOR MODERN LIFE </h2>
						<p class="text-info"> Natural gas, nuclear, and coal power plants produce 86 percent of the electricity needs of the U.S. These plants can run continuously, 
						and they can be built just about anywhere. On-demand electricity powers everything 
						from our favorite electronics and the Internet to air conditioners and modern factories.</p>
						<h2 class="text-success" id="section3"> UNRELIABLE POWER MAKES BLACKOUTS MORE LIKELY </h2>
						<p class="text-info"> Wind and solar installations provide about 4 percent of our electricity. These plants are unreliable because their output depends 
						on whether the wind is blowing or the 
						sun is shining. With increasing production from wind and solar plants, grid operators 
						struggle to keep electricity supply and demand in balance. When supply can't keep up with demand, the grid becomes unreliable and whole
						 regions can experience blackouts. </p>
						<h2 class="text-success" id="section4"> HIGH-VOLTAGE TRANSMISSION LINES CARRY POWER FROM GENERATORS TO LOCAL DISTRIBUTION NETWORKS </h2>
						<p class="text-info">To minimize power loss, after the electricity leaves the power plant, it is "stepped up" at substations to high voltage and then moved long-distance 
						across transmission lines to get where it is needed. Behind the scenes, the transmission grid is kept in balance by trained grid operators 
						who monitor this flow of electricity and ensure that supply matches demand every second of the day. </p>
						<h2 class="text-success" id="section5">HOW DOES ELECTRICITY REACH YOU?</h2>
						<p class="text-info">Step-down transformers lower the voltage of electricity coming from the transmission grid, and distribution lines take the power 
						to your home or business. Small transformers commonly seen on utility poles step the voltage down again to levels that are safe for 
						your home wiring and appliances. </p>
						<h2 class="text-success" id="section6">THE ELECTRIC GRID POWERS OUR LIVES</h2>
						<p class="text-info">Reliable, affordable power is nothing short of an everyday miracle. We use it to power our homes, businesses, schools, and hospitals.
						It literally lights up our lives and makes our modern-day conveniences possible. </p>
