					<p>Electricity makes our lives better, brighter, and cleaner. After electricity is 
					generated at a power plant, it needs to be transmitted on high-voltage power lines before it can be 
					distributed to our homes and businesses. This page focuses on the middle stage—electricity transmission 
					from power plants to local distribution grids. In many ways, electricity transmission is the unsung hero of our modern,
					electrified economy. The U.S. transmission grid delivers power so reliably that widespread blackouts—like the Northeast 
					blackouts of 1965 and 2003—are rare, unforgettable moments in U.S. history. In the past, the transmission grid has been 
					reliable. Yet in the future, that might not be the case, as new laws and regulations threaten to make the grid unstable.

					<h2>History of Transmission</h2>
					<p>In the 1880s, electric lighting systems were some of the first applications of electricity to modern American life. 
					In those early systems—like Thomas Edison’s Pearl Street Station in Manhattan, which energized America’s first power grid—electric 
					power stations served customers in a small network that covered only a few city blocks.
					</p>
					<p>
					One of the biggest differences between the small electricity grid at Pearl Street and the electricity we use today is that Edison 
					used direct current (DC), while today’s grids use alternating current (AC). Early power grids were small by today’s standards, in 
					part because of the physics of direct current networks. DC networks had to operate at low voltages in order to be safe, the downside 
					being that transmitting low-voltage power is inefficient. Much of the power is lost in the form of heat, and the power simply cannot 
					be transmitted very far.[1]

				<h2>The Alternating Current Breakthrough</h2>
				<p>A Serbian-American inventor named Nikola Tesla is the most famous of the electrical engineers who revolutionized the way we transmit 
				electricity. Working with entrepreneur George Westinghouse, Tesla and the early AC engineers made long-distance electricity transmission 
				possible.[3] Instead of generating DC power, their solution was to generate a completely different kind of electric power—AC—and to use new 
				transformers to increase and decrease the voltage. That was the beauty of the AC breakthrough: it meant that electricity could be transformed 
				from low to high voltage and back, which increased the efficiency of transmission and allowed Westinghouse’s early transmission lines to span 
				longer distances.
				</p>

				<h2> Universal Electric Power </h2>
				<p>Samuel Insull, a pioneering young businessman who had worked as Edison’s assistant and then business partner, had a breathtaking vision
				for electricity in the era of long-distance transmission. Edison encouraged Insull to test the boundaries of their business. “Do it big, Sammy,
				” he instructed. “Make it either a big success or a big failure.”[8] In 1892, Insull left Edison’s former company in the New York area to pave 
				his own way with a growing electricity company in Chicago (Chicago Edison, now Commonwealth Edison).[9]
				</p>
				<p>Insull’s focus on spreading electricity to new customers made him one of the great “democratizers” in American history. By the end of the 
				1920s, his companies were serving more than four million customers in 32 states.[11] He would go on to network his transmission facilities with 
				of other companies, creating an interconnected web of electricity that powered cities and farms alike and laid the foundation for today’s power 
				grid.

				<h2> How Electricity Transmission Works </h2>
				<p>
					The characteristic feature of modern electricity transmission is the high-voltage power lines that stretch across the entire continent. 
					In the U.S., there are over 200,000 miles of high-voltage transmission lines (i.e., 230,000 volts and above)—enough to wrap around the 
					Earth more than eight times.[12] All of these lines networked together create a type of superhighway that moves electricity from the power 
					plants where it is generated to local distribution systems, which ultimately deliver it to homes and businesses.
