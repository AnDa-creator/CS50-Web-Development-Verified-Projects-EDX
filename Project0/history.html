							<h2 class="text-body">Revolutionary Power</h2>
							<p> Although people have known about electricity since ancient times, they’ve only been harnessing its power for about 250 years. 
							Benjamin Franklin’s electricity experiments – including his famous kite experiment in 1752 – showed just how little we knew about 
							electricity in the era of the American revolution and the first industrial revolution.[1] In the time since Franklin’s experiments, 
							our grasp of electricity has grown tremendously, and we are constantly finding new ways to use it to improve our lives.	</p>

							<p>One of the first major breakthroughs in electricity occurred in 1831, when British scientist Michael Faraday discovered the basic 
							principles of electricity generation.[2] Building on the experiments of Franklin and others, he observed that he could create or “induce” 
							electric current by moving magnets inside coils of copper wire. The discovery of electromagnetic induction revolutionized how we use energy.
							In fact, Faraday’s process is used in modern power production, although today’s power plants produce much stronger currents on a much larger
							scale than Faraday’s hand-held device.</p>
							<p>In the era of modern power plants, coal has always generated more electricity in the U.S. than any other fuel source. In recent decades, 
							we have seen other sources compete for second place: first hydroelectricity, then natural gas, nuclear power, and natural gas again.</p>

							<p>We also use electricity to power an increasing number of devices. Our modern electric world began with applications like the telegraph, light bulb, 
							and telephone, and continued with radio, television, and many household appliances. Most recently, electrons have powered the digital age to create what 
							energy expert Vaclav Smil calls our “instantaneously interconnected global civilization.”[3] Technology expert Mark Mills points out that electricity powers 
							an increasing portion of our economy. The always-on data centers that support the internet and “cloud computing” will continue to increase demand for 
							electricity, overwhelming the modest decreases in electricity use in other parts of the economy, such as manufacturing processes.[4][5]</p>

							<h2 class="text-body">The Dawn of Electric Light in the U.S.</h2>	
							<p> One of the greatest pioneers in electricity was Thomas Edison, who saw electricity as his “field of fields” to “reorganize the life of the world.”
							Working tirelessly on electricity from his laboratory in New Jersey in the 1870s, America’s greatest inventor brought the incandescent electric light
							bulb into practical use by the end of that decade and patented the incandescent light bulb in 1880.[11] “When Edison…snatched up the spark of Prometheus
							in his little pear-shaped glass bulb, ”German historian Emil Ludwig observed, “it meant that fire had been discovered for the second time, that mankind 
							had been delivered again from the curse of night.”[12] Yet Edison’s electric light was even better than fire—it was brighter, more consistent, and safer
							than the flame of candles or lamps.</p>
							<p>Edison’s light bulb was one of the first applications of electricity to modern life. He initially worked with J. P. Morgan and a few privileged 
							customers in New York City in the 1880s to light their homes, pairing his new incandescent bulbs with small generators. Edison’s electric lighting 
							systems were basic by today’s standards but bold at the time—they not only threatened the existing gas lighting industry but radically challenged 
							the status quo by introducing people to an entirely new type of energy. In a few short years, Edison transformed electricity from a science experiment
							into an exciting, safe, and coveted luxury.</p>

							<h2 class="text-body">A Powerful Vision</h2>
							<p> Electricity remains a growth industry today, in spite of political meddling at the local, state, and federal level. New vistas for electricity 
							will always be there for people to discover, but that discovery will require the freedom to inspire new inventions. Let the next generation of 
							electricity entrepreneurs be driven—like Edison and Insull—by the productive forces of human ingenuity and healthy competition.</p>
							<p> Electricity is modern life. Without access to reliable power, our lives would be much more like they were before the industrial revolution 
							(to quote Thomas Hobbes): “solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.”[30] Nearly every feature of modern civilization depends on affordable, 
							reliable electricity and the things it powers—lamps and heaters to safely keep our homes well-lit and comfortable, smart phones to stay in touch 
							with loved ones, and always-on data centers to give us a reliable Internet—among countless others. It is so crucial to modern life, in fact, that
							the history of electricity is really the history of the modern world.</p>
